# 👋 About Me

I’m **Sudhanshu Mehta**, an MBA candidate at **University Canada West** with over a decade of experience as a globally recognized photographer. My work has taken me across continents, capturing stories through visual narratives. But beyond the lens, I’ve always been drawn to the business side of storytelling—how creativity meets strategy.

Now, I’m channeling that passion into business transformation. My goal is to bridge art and analytics by leveraging **AI**, **digital tools**, and **entrepreneurial thinking** to drive innovation and sustainable value.
